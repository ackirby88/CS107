Welcome to the C++ track of Harvard's 2020 CS107: Systems Development for Computational Science.  
This repository holds educational content and code snippets for learning C and C++.  
Additionally within the repo, you will find content on compiling code via Makefiles and CMake. There is a example project using CMake which demonstrates how to setup automated Unit Testing through Google Tests (GTest).

The [C/C++ Track Outline](https://github.com/ackirby88/CS107/blob/master/cpp-overview.md) provides a simple follow along for learning the basics.
