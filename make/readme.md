### GNU Make -- Makefiles
---
[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is a tool for **build automation** of programs by reading files called `Makefiles` which contain instructions for compiling source code.  
The resources below provide references to tutorials, documentation, cheat sheats, and example projects developed herein.

### Tutorials
- [Make Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/): GNU Make's Tutorial.
- [GCC+Make Tutorial](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/gcc_make.html): A comprehensive tutorial of GCC and Make.
- [A Simple Makefile Tutorial](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/): An entry-level tutorial for GNU Make with several examples.

### Resources
- [Make Documentation (pdf)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/0910/UnixTools/make.pdf): Comprehensive GNU Make reference (174 pages).
- [Make Documentation (html)](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html): Same as previous but html version.
- [Make Quick Reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Quick-Reference.html): GNU Make's directive quick reference.

### Cheat Sheets
- [Make Examples](https://cppcheatsheet.com/notes/c_make.html): Excellent examples of Make functionality.
- [Make Variables](http://eduardolezcano.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/make_cheatsheet.pdf): Table-version cheat sheet of Make variables.

### Harvard CS107 Examples
We have created four example projects, each with manually-generated Makefiles. 
- [Demo 1](https://github.com/ackirby88/CS107/tree/master/make/demo1): Basic example of hard-coded Makefile for small C++ project.
- [Demo 2](https://github.com/ackirby88/CS107/tree/master/make/demo2): Comprehensive example of more generalized Makefile with `src`, `include`, and `build` directories.
- [Demo 3](https://github.com/ackirby88/CS107/tree/master/make/demo3): Multi-compiler example of Makefiles.
- [Mixed Programming Language Library](https://github.com/ackirby88/CS107/tree/master/make/cpp_f95_library_demo): Following `demo2` Makefile, this example demonstrates the construction for a Fortran95 library and linking it to a C++ program. This example shows how to call Fortran functions from C++ code.
