# CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a cross-platform free and open-source software tool for managing the build process of software using a compiler-independent method. 
It supports directory hierarchies and applications that depend on multiple libraries.

## Installation
- [Installation Instructions](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/intro/installing.html): Instructions for installing CMake on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
- [Youtube Linux Install Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yFPO1ofyF0&list=PLK6MXr8gasrGmIiSuVQXpfFuE1uPT615s): Youtube tutorial for installation on Linux.

It's also recommended to install ccmake or a cmake-gui. These tools enable easy manipulation of build variables without using the command line interface.
